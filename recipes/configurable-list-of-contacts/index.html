<p>Most themes offer quick social media links with site configuration.
However, it is only limited to popular media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, GitHub, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get around this, we’ll make use of <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/">data templates</a>.
Let’s create a quick game plan how does it work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data is a top-level dictionary/object with each key contains an object with the following fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>url</code> is the…​ contact link itself and it is required to have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>name</code> is the text to appear in the output.
Also required to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>weight</code> is an integer similar to how Hugo sorts the pages with the lower weight having high precedence;
if this key is absent, it will be interpreted as 0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And here’s the data example in TOML which is placed in <code>data/contact.toml</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml">[github]
    name = &#34;GitHub&#34;
    url = &#34;https://github.com/foo-dogsquared&#34;

[gitlab]
    name = &#34;Gitlab&#34;
    url = &#34;https://gitlab.com/foo-dogsquared&#34;

[keybase]
    name = &#34;Keybase&#34;
    url = &#34;https://keybase.io/foo_dogsquared&#34;
    weight = -1

[twitter]
    name = &#34;Twitter&#34;
    url = &#34;https://twitter.com/foo_dogsquared&#34;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want my Keybase profile to appear first than anything else for whatever reason so the <code>weight</code> key is set to -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this data, we can then create a template out of it.
I’ve put the following template in a partial named <code>contacts</code> (i.e., <code>layouts/partials/contacts</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go">&lt;address&gt;
{{- range (sort $.Site.Data.contacts &#34;weight&#34; &#34;asc&#34;) -}}
| &lt;a rel=&#34;me&#34; href=&#34;{{ .url }}&#34;&gt;{{- .name -}}&lt;/a&gt; |
{{- end -}}
&lt;/address&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A suggestion (and an exercise) for extending this is to create image links.
Maybe add another key named <code>image</code> that accepts either URL.
The <code>name</code> would now be the image alternative text.</p>
