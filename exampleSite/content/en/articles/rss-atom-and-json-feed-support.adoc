This theme supports RSS, Atom, and JSON feed output for more ways of publishing web content for your visitors.
It is also suitable for reading content from feed readers.

Here are the following documents used as references for the creation of the output feed templates.

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom 1.0 - IETF RFC4287]
* https://jsonfeed.org/version/1[JSON Feed version 1 specifications]
* https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html[RSS 2.0 specifications]

In this demo, it is enabled and you should be able to see them through the following links:

* **RSS**: `$HUGO_URL/index.rss`
* **Atom**: `$HUGO_URL/index.atom`
* **JSON**: `$HUGO_URL/index.json`

For enabling output feeds, utilize the https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats[output formats] in your site configuration.

If you're settling with this option, here's an example template for enabling all of the feed formats.
